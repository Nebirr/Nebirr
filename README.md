## 👋 Hi, I'm Nebirr

I'm primarily working with **C++** and I'm especially interested in
**camera control, computer vision, and system-level software development**.

My focus is on writing **clean, understandable code** and building
projects that interact with **real devices and real constraints**.

---

### 🔧 Technical Focus
- C++ (C++17 / C++20)
- Camera & device control
- OpenCV
- CMake
- Multithreading & basic performance considerations
- Cross-platform development (Windows / Linux)

---

### 🚀 Selected Projects

- **Camera-Control**  
  C++ application for camera control, live streaming and image capture.  
  Focus on device interaction, modular architecture and extendability.

- **Atlas AI**  
  Desktop application with a modular architecture, release builds and
  practical integration of multiple subsystems.

---

### 🎯 Goal
Entry-level position in **C++ development**, preferably in the area of
**camera systems, computer vision or system-near software**.

---

### 📌 Notes
I am continuously improving my projects and using GitHub as a place to
document my learning and practical work.
